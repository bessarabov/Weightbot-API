NAME
    Weightbot::API - Get Weightbot iPhone app data from weightbot.com

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    There is a great iPhone weight tracking app
    http://tapbots.com/software/weightbot/. It backups it's data to the site
    https://weightbot.com/ where everybody who uses that app can login and
    download the file with the records.

    This module gets that data and shows it as a pretty data structure.

        use Weightbot::API;
        use Data::Dumper;

        my $wi = Weightbot::API->new({
            email    => 'user@example.com',
            password => '******',
        }); 

        say $wi->raw_data;
        say Dumper $wi->data;

    The object does not send requests to site until data is needed to be
    retrieved. The first executed method data() or raw_data() will get data
    from the site and the data will be stored in the object, so you can use
    raw_data() and data() many times without unnecessary requests.

    Site https://weightbot.com/ does not have real API, this module behaves
    as a browser.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Creates new object. It has to get parameters 'email' and 'password'.
    Optionally you can specify 'site' with some custom site url (default is
    'https://weightbot.com'). The other optional thing is to specify
    'raw_data'.

        my $wi = Weightbot::API->new({
            email    => 'user@example.com',
            password => '******',
        }); 

  raw_data
    Returns the weight records in the format as they are stored on the site.
    Here is an example:

        date, kilograms, pounds
        2008-12-04, 80.9, 178.4
        2008-12-05, 82.6, 182.1
        2008-12-06, 81.9, 180.6
        2008-12-08, 82.6, 182.1

    You can run this method many times but only the first run will get data
    from the site.

  data
    Returns the weight data in a structure. In that data some dates can be
    skipped. In this structure all the dates are present, but if there is no
    weight for that date the empty sting is used.

    An example for the data show in raw_data() method:

        $VAR1 = [
                  {
                    'n' => 1,
                    'date' => '2008-12-04',
                    'kg' => '80.9',
                    'lb' => '178.4'
                  },
                  {
                    'n' => 2,
                    'date' => '2008-12-05',
                    'kg' => '82.6',
                    'lb' => '182.1'
                  },
                  {
                    'n' => 3,
                    'date' => '2008-12-06',
                    'kg' => '81.9',
                    'lb' => '180.6'
                  },
                  {
                    'n' => 4,
                    'date' => '2008-12-07',
                    'kg' => '',
                    'lb' => ''
                  },
                  {
                    'n' => 5,
                    'date' => '2008-12-08',
                    'kg' => '82.6',
                    'lb' => '182.1'
                  }
                ];
