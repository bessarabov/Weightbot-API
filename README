NAME
    Weightbot::API - get Weightbot iPhone app data from weightbot.com

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
    There is a great iPhone weight tracking app
    http://tapbots.com/software/weightbot/. It backups its data to the site
    https://weightbot.com/ where everyone using that app can login and
    download the file with the records.

    This module gets that data and shows it as a pretty data structure.

        use Weightbot::API;
        use Data::Dumper;

        my $wi = Weightbot::API->new({
            email    => 'user@example.com',
            password => '******',
        });

        say $wi->raw_data;
        say Dumper $wi->data;

    The object does not send requests to site until data needs to be
    retrieved. The first invocation of either data() or raw_data() methods
    will get data from the site and it will be stored in the object, so you
    can use raw_data() and data() many times without unnecessary requests to
    the site.

    Site https://weightbot.com/ does not have real API, this module behaves
    as a browser.

  NOTES
    While debugging your programme that uses this module it is not a great
    idea to send requests to weightbot.com on every test run. This module
    can cache data to file. The module will read data from the cache file if
    the file exists or will download data and save it to the file if there
    is no cache file.

    To use this feature you should create Weightbot::API object with:

        my $wi = Weightbot::API->new({
            email    => 'user@example.com',
            password => '******',
            use_cache_file => 1,
            cache_file     => '/storage/weightbot.raw',     # optional
        });

    The default value for 'cache_file' is '/tmp/weightbot.data'.

    So when you debug your programme you can specify 'use_cache_file'. Then
    on first run the data will be downloaded from weightbot.com and saved to
    file and all other runs will use data from the file without asking
    weightbot.com.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Creates new object. It has to get parameters 'email' and 'password'.
    Optionally you can specify 'site' with some custom site url (default is
    'https://weightbot.com'). The other optional thing is to specify
    'raw_data'.

        my $wi = Weightbot::API->new({
            email    => 'user@example.com',
            password => '******',
        });

  raw_data
    Returns the weight records in the format as they are stored on the site.
    Here is an example:

        date, kilograms, pounds
        2008-12-04, 80.9, 178.4
        2008-12-05, 82.6, 182.1
        2008-12-06, 81.9, 180.6
        2008-12-08, 82.6, 182.1

    Any subsequent call to this method will not result in actual data
    retrieval as the data is cached within the object.

  data
    Returns the weight data in a structure. In that data some dates can be
    skipped. In this structure all the dates are present, but if there is no
    weight for that date the empty sting is used.

    An example for the data show in raw_data() method:

        $VAR1 = [
                  {
                    'n' => 1,
                    'date' => '2008-12-04',
                    'kg' => '80.9',
                    'lb' => '178.4'
                  },
                  {
                    'n' => 2,
                    'date' => '2008-12-05',
                    'kg' => '82.6',
                    'lb' => '182.1'
                  },
                  {
                    'n' => 3,
                    'date' => '2008-12-06',
                    'kg' => '81.9',
                    'lb' => '180.6'
                  },
                  {
                    'n' => 4,
                    'date' => '2008-12-07',
                    'kg' => '',
                    'lb' => ''
                  },
                  {
                    'n' => 5,
                    'date' => '2008-12-08',
                    'kg' => '82.6',
                    'lb' => '182.1'
                  }
                ];

    Any subsequent call to this method will not result in actual data
    retrieval as the data is cached within the object.
